## Purpose

This project was created by [me](https://github.com/kazvee) as part of my learnings at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program).

## Setup

1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
2. Create `config/database.yml` by copying `config/database.example.yml`
3. Create `config/secrets.yml` by copying `config/secrets.example.yml`
4. Run `bin/rails db:reset` to create, load and seed both the `development` and `test` databases
5. Create .env file based on .env.example
6. Sign up for a Stripe account
7. Put Stripe (test) keys into appropriate .env vars
8. Run `bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0` to start the server

## Database

If Rails is complaining about authentication to the database, uncomment the user and password fields from `config/database.yml` in the development and test sections, and replace if necessary the user and password `development` to an existing database user.

## Testing

### Rspec

Use command `bin/rspec` to run all tests (specs) in the `spec` directory.\
Alternatively run `bin/rspec --format documentation` for more verbose results, or create a `.rspec` file in project root which contains `--format documentation` to keep the flag on.

### Cypress

Use command `bin/rails cypress:open` to run all tests in the `cypress/integration` folder.

## Stripe Testing

Use Credit Card # 4111 1111 1111 1111 for testing success scenarios.

More information in their docs: <https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards>
